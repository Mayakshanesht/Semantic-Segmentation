# Semantic-Segmentation
Here i learn how to do semantic segmentation for drivable area detection and steps followed are as follows,
1. Setting up environment
2. loading dataset
3. Data preprocessing
4. Model for semantic segmentation: Here I have tried two different networks and bt still earlier network seems more accurate
5. testing on Berkeley driving dataset:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-5OR0xUZtBsiLcjXipK5V2IyAkhav2Py/view?usp=sharing
